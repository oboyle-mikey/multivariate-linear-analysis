Multivariate Linear Analysis

This repo is to showcase the assignments and labwork that is accumulated in a college module Multivariate Analysis. 
It contains algorithms centred around three key areas of MLA namely:
      - Data Reduction
      - Clustering
      - Classification
      
The repository will also house the course assignment for the module implementing the techniques and algorithms.
